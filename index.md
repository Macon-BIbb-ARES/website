## Macon-Bibb Amateur Radio Emergency Service [(ARES)](http://www.arrl.org/ares)

ARES is a group of dedicated Amateur Radio volunteers ("Hams") that provide emergency communications [(EmComm)](http://www.arrl.org/emergency-communications) for various public safety agencies in the Middle GA area in a time of disaster and infrastructure failure.  Our National Weather Service [(NWS)](http://www.weather.gov/) trained members also provide weather related information for the Central Georgia Area through the NWS [SkyWarn](http://www.weather.gov/skywarn/) spotter program.

### When all else fails-- Amateur Radio works!
