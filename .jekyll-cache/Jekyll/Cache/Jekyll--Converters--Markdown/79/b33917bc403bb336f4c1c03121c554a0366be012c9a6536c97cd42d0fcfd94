 Â D-Â­â€STAR Linking	
 Â Tips
For	
 Â local operation (Macon ,	
 Â GA) program and	
 Â store a memory as follows:
2 meter VHF 70cm UHF 1.2 GHz Voice 1.2 GHz Data
Frequency: 145.340-Â­â€ (0.6) 440.625+ (5.0) N/A 1297.3750
UR: CQCQCQ CQCQCQ
RPT1: WX4EMA C WX4EMA B
RPT2: WX4EMA G WX4EMA G
(Note that any module designations must be in	
 Â the 8th position	
 Â regardless of	
 Â callsign	
 Â length. If	
 Â a	
 Â callsign is
shorter than	
 Â 6 characters, add	
 Â spaces to ensure the module letter is in	
 Â the 8th position.	
 Â  Always use the	
 Â 
repeater callsign with	
 Â G	
 Â in RPT2 to allow DV	
 Â Dongle and	
 Â linked	
 Â repeaters to	
 Â hear you	
 Â and	
 Â be heard)
Repeater Linking (To	
 Â link a repeater module to another repeater)
Example:	
 Â To link WX4EMA C (2m) to WX4GPB	
 Â C (Stone Mountain), set another memory for the
following	
 Â and	
 Â key for one second:
Frequency: 145.340-Â­â€ UR: WX4GPBCL RPT1:	
 Â WX4EMA C RPT2: WX4EMA G
After	
 Â repeater announces that it is	
 Â linked, move back to memory for	
 Â local operation:
Frequency: 145.340-Â­â€ UR:	
 Â CQCQCQ RPT1:	
 Â WX4EMA C RPT2: WX4EMA G
To unlink repeater: Set a memory as follows:	
 Â  UR: <strong>**</strong><em>U RPT1:	
 Â Wx4EMA C RPT2:
(Note * in	
 Â UR is a	
 Â space, the U	
 Â is in	
 Â the 8th position, frequency is still the repeater	
 Â frequency)
To see if a	
 Â repeater	
 Â is	
 Â linked:	
 Â  Program a memory for:
Frequency: 145.340-Â­â€ UR: WX4EMA I RPT1:	
 Â WX4EMA C RPT2: WX4EMA G
If	
 Â repeater	
 Â is not linked, it will	
 Â announce its ID.	
 Â  If	
 Â it is linked	
 Â somewhere, it will	
 Â say â€œRepeater already	
 Â 
linkedâ€.
Linking to	
 Â Reflectors
Reflectors are locations where multiple repeaters or Dongle users can	
 Â connect simultaneously (aka a	
 Â 
conference bridge). Reflectors are designated	
 Â as REF001C,	
 Â â€¦2C,	
 Â â€¦3C,	
 Â etc. Each	
 Â reflector	
 Â has three	
 Â 
separate conference locations designated	
 Â by the letter	
 Â at the end.	
 Â  For	
 Â example, you can	
 Â connect to	
 Â 
REF001A, REF001B or REF001C. Think of	
 Â it as three separate conference bridges.
To link to a	
 Â reflector (ex. REF001C) from Wx4EMA C, program as follows:
Frequency:	
 Â 	
 Â 145.340-Â­â€ UR: REF001CL RPT1: WX4EMA C RPT2: WX4EMA G
Unlink as above.

The Southeast D-Â­â€STAR Weather	
 Â Net operates each Sunday night at 9:00pm ET on REF002A	
 Â during	
 Â nonemergency times.	
 Â 	
 Â  The net was formed to practice a wide area	
 Â net over a	
 Â linked repeater network for	
 Â 
emergency weather conditions in	
 Â the southeast such	
 Â as hurricanes, tropical weather, tornadoes or	
 Â 
severe thunderstorms. All check inâ€™s are welcome and	
 Â encouraged. Just link your local	
 Â repeater	
 Â to	
 Â 
REF002A	
 Â just before 9:00pm on	
 Â Sunday evenings. Check-Â­â€in is taken	
 Â by state for	
 Â each	
 Â southeastern	
 Â 
state. During	
 Â severe weather	
 Â conditions, link your	
 Â local	
 Â repeater	
 Â to REF002A to monitor for emergency	
 Â 
communications.</p>
