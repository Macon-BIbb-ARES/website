# **WX4EMA D-STAR Linking Tips** 
For local operation ( **_Macon , GA_** ) program and store a memory as follows:

|            | 2 meter VHF    | 70cm UHF       | 1.2 GHz Data |
|------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Frequency: | 145.340- (0.6) | 440.625+ (5.0) | 1297.3750    |
| UR:        | CQCQCQ         | CQCQCQ         |              |
| RPT1:      | WX4EMA C       | WX4EMA B       |              |
| RPT2:      | WX4EMA G       | WX4EMA G       |              |

_(Note that any module designations must be in the  8<sup>th</sup>position	regardless of callsign length. If a callsign_ (^) _is shorter than 6 characters, add spaces to ensure the module letter is in the 8<sup>th</sup> position. Always use the repeater callsign with G in RPT 2 to allow DV Dongle and linked	repeaters to hear you and be heard)_

## Repeater Linking (To link a repeater module to another repeater)

### Example:	
 To link WX4EMA C ( 2 m) to WX 4 GPB C (Stone Mountain), set another memory for the
following and key for one second:

>**Frequency:** 145. 340 - **UR:** WX4GPBCL **RPT 1:** WX4EMA C **RPT2:** WX4EMA G

After repeater announces that it is linked, move back to memory for local operation:
>**Frequency:** 145. 340 - **UR:** CQCQCQ **RPT 1 :**	WX4EMA C **RPT2:** WX4EMA G


### To unlink repeater : 
Set a memory as follows:	
>**UR:** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*U **RPT 1** : Wx4EMA C **RPT2:**(Note * in UR is a space, the U is in the 8<sup>th</sup> position, frequency is still the repeater frequency)

### To see if a repeater is linked :	
 Program a memory for:
>**Frequency:** 145. 340 - **UR:** WX4EMA I **RPT 1** :	
 WX4EMA C **RPT2:** WX4EMA G
If repeater is not linked, it will announce its ID.	
 If it is linked somewhere, it will say “Repeater already	
linked”.

### Linking to Reflectors


Reflectors are locations where multiple repeaters or Dongle users can connect simultaneously (aka a	
conference bridge). Reflectors are designated as REF 001 C, ...2C, ...3C, etc. Each reflector has three	
separate conference locations designated by the letter at the end. For example, you can connect to	
REF 001 A, REF 001 B or REF 001 C. Think of it as three separate conference bridges.

To link to a reflector (ex. REF 001 C) from Wx4EMA C, program as follows:
>**Frequency:** 145.340 - **UR:** REF 001 CL **RPT1:** WX4EMA C **RPT 2** : WX4EMA G

Unlink as above.

## US Reflectors (see entire list of reflectors at [http://www.dstarinfo.com/reflectors.aspx](http://www.dstarinfo.com/reflectors.aspx)


| REF001A                              | REF004A – *BackupSE WeatherNet *          |
| REF001B – Illinois D-­STAR repeaters | REF004B – Texas	Permalink Repeaters        |
| REF001C – D-STAR’s MegaRepeater    | REF004C – General Rag Chew (English)      |
| REF002A – *SE Weather Net*           | REF014C – West Coast repeater linking     |
| REF002B                              | REF030B – *Georgia EmComm Use/ARES*       |
| REF002C                              | REF030C – *Georgia/Southeast US	Repeaters* |

**Southeast D-STAR Weather Net Yahoo Group:** [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/se_wxnet/](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/se_wxnet/)
The Southeast D-STAR Weather Net operates each Sunday night at 9:00 pm ET on REF 002 A during non-­emergency times. The net was formed to practice a wide area net over a linked repeater network for emergency weather conditions in the southeast such as hurricanes, tropical weather, tornadoes or	severe thunderstorms. All check in’s are welcome and encouraged. Just link your local repeater to REF 002 A just before 9:00 pm on Sunday evenings. Check-­in is taken by state for each southeastern state. During severe weather conditions, link your local repeater to REF 002 A to monitor for emergency communications.
