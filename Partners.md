The [Macon-Bibb County Emergency Management Agency](http://www.maconbibb.us/emergency-management-agency/)  (Spencer Hawkins - Macon/Bibb EMA Director) provides us with state of the art amateur radio equipment at the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) located in beautiful downtown Macon.  This equipment enables us to establish communications with Georgia Emergency Management Agency [(GEMA)](http://www.gema.state.ga.us/) and various other state and national organizations during the time of need.  We also work in conjunction with the EMA to staff the EOC and its mobile command post for communications with our volunteers allowing the EMA staff to concentrate on damage assessments and other important duties assisting the public in the time of need.


Other agencies we serve are the [Macon-Bibb County Sheriff's Office](http://www.bibbsheriff.org/), [Macon-Bibb Co. Fire Department](http://www.maconbibb.us/fire-department/), various EMS agencies, and the [American Red Cross](http://www.centralga-redcross.org/).  Our volunteers also provide emergency communications for hospitals located in Region 5 or (F) area when needed.
